      <h3 class=" text-center ">Chicken</h3>
      <p>I made this chicken this weekend and my daughter said it should be called "Kick-butt" chicken. My family loved it. I put the chicken and the sauce in a plastic bag and left it in the fridge all day and baked it that evening. I did baste it and that kept it very moist. I would recommend using chicken with skin on (even though I usually don't bake with the skin on) because the pieces with skin on seemed moister than the pieces without. I didn't have any hot sauce and it was still great. So were the leftovers. Oh, and I took the cover off the last 15 or 20 minutes and it was an appetizing golden brown color. Excellent.</p>
